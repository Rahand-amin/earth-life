                    Life People have been looking towards the sky for as long as they have been on the Earth,  
    
                    It seems only natural that civilizations would begin to wonder if life <br>

                    on Earth is the only life in the universe.

                    Understanding what makes life on Earth is the first step to examining <br>

                    he possibility of life elsewhere.

                    What is Life? Trying to define life is difficult.<br>

                    There is no clear-cut, basic definition of what life is. 

                    It is easier to identify the properties of life and decide whether or not something falls into the life  <br>

                    or nonlife category based on if it includes these properties.
                    The six properties of life are order, reproduction, growth and development,<br>
                    energy utilization, homeostasis, and evolutionary adaptation.
                    This process results in the more advantageous traits being passed on through<br>
                    the generations as the less valuable traits are lost.
                    Life on Earth Life on Earth is dependent on three factors:<br>
                    a source of nutrients, a source of energy, and liquid water (Bennett, 2012, p. 510). 
                    If one of these three requirements was not present on Earth,<br>
                    life could not continue. Nutrients, atoms and molecules, 
                    are the necessities for building living cells (Bennett, 2012, p. 510).  <br>
                    Energy can come from many sources including the Sun, chemical reactions,
                    and the natural heat from the Earth (Bennett, 2012, p. 510). <br>
                    This energy is the fuel for all life. Liquid water,
                    something found in abundance on Earth, is the last needed factor. <br>
                    History of Life on Earth Life on Earth has existed for a relatively 
                    long time when compared to the age of the Earth. Life likely first<br>
                    began about 3.8 billion years ago, less than a billion years after 
                    the Earth was formed.<br>
                    What substance covers three fourths of the earth and is essential
                    for sustaining life? The answer is water; according to Maslow 's <br>
                    hierarchy of needs pyramid water is placed at the bottom,
                    which is the foundation of the pyramid, this means that<br>
                    water is one of the foundations of life and essential for
                    living on this earth. Although the earth is made of seventy five <br>
                    percent of water only about two percent of it is safe for proper use
                    and consumption and what 's worse the only two percent of water we<br>
                    can use is quickly being drained by inefficient farming/agriculture
                    and reckless water usage. Even if people do not realize it right now<br>
                    the world is in a major water crisis and if we don 't change our ways 
                    soon, we’ll run out, but we don 't have to, there are solutions that<br>
                    could reduce and solve the water crisis problem and they include 
                    informing the public, funding desalination plant, and looking at how <br>
                    we use our water. We’re running out of water and not many people know 
                    about it or care enough to try and solve it, there are multiple <br>
                    reasons and causes of why we are running out of water.
                    One reason we are running out of water was mentioned earlier,<br>
                    only about two percent of the water is safe for consumption but
                    it doesn 't stop there.
