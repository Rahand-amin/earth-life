    Life People have been looking towards the sky for as long as they have been on the Earth,  
    
    It seems only natural that civilizations would begin to wonder if life <br>

    on Earth is the only life in the universe.

    Understanding what makes life on Earth is the first step to examining <br>

    he possibility of life elsewhere.

    What is Life? Trying to define life is difficult.<br>

    There is no clear-cut, basic definition of what life is. 

    It is easier to identify the properties of life and decide whether or not something falls into the life  <br>

    or nonlife category based on if it includes these properties.
    The six properties of life are order, reproduction, growth and development,<br>
    energy utilization, homeostasis, and evolutionary adaptation.
    This process results in the more advantageous traits being passed on through<br>
     the generations as the less valuable traits are lost.
     Life on Earth Life on Earth is dependent on three factors:<br>
     a source of nutrients, a source of energy, and liquid water (Bennett, 2012, p. 510). 
     If one of these three requirements was not present on Earth,<br>
     life could not continue. Nutrients, atoms and molecules, 
     are the necessities for building living cells (Bennett, 2012, p. 510).  <br>
     Energy can come from many sources including the Sun, chemical reactions,
     and the natural heat from the Earth (Bennett, 2012, p. 510). <br>
     This energy is the fuel for all life. Liquid water,
     something found in abundance on Earth, is the last needed factor. <br>
      History of Life on Earth Life on Earth has existed for a relatively 
      long time when compared to the age of the Earth. Life likely first<br>
       began about 3.8 billion years ago, less than a billion years after 
       the Earth was formed.<br>
       What substance covers three fourths of the earth and is essential
        for sustaining life? The answer is water; according to Maslow 's <br>
        hierarchy of needs pyramid water is placed at the bottom,
         which is the foundation of the pyramid, this means that<br>
          water is one of the foundations of life and essential for
           living on this earth. Although the earth is made of seventy five <br>
           percent of water only about two percent of it is safe for proper use
            and consumption and what 's worse the only two percent of water we<br>
         can use is quickly being drained by inefficient farming/agriculture
         and reckless water usage. Even if people do not realize it right now<br>
         the world is in a major water crisis and if we don 't change our ways 
         soon, we’ll run out, but we don 't have to, there are solutions that<br>
         could reduce and solve the water crisis problem and they include 
         informing the public, funding desalination plant, and looking at how <br>
         we use our water. We’re running out of water and not many people know 
         about it or care enough to try and solve it, there are multiple <br>
         reasons and causes of why we are running out of water.
          One reason we are running out of water was mentioned earlier,<br>
           only about two percent of the water is safe for consumption but
            it doesn 't stop there.
